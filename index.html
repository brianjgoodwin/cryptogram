      <h1>Cryptogram - Instructions</h1>
      <p>In this game, you'll see a quote that has been changed using a secret code, also known as a Cryptogram. The code switches each letter with a different one. Your job is to figure out which letters match up and decode the original quote. When you successfully decode the quote, you win and you can try your luck on a new Cryptogram.</p>
      <h3>Choosing Letters</h3>
      <p>To guess a letter, just click on the letter you think is right, and then type the same letter on your keyboard. The game will put your guess in all the right places in your Cryptogram.</p>
      <p>If you can't figure out what a letter is, you can use the <b>hint</b> feature. Click on the letter that needs a hint, and press the <b>hint</b> button (the question mark symbol).</p>
      <p>You can also reset your guesses by pressing the <b>reset</b> button.</p>

      <!-- <p>Because of patterns of words and letters in the English language, it's possible to make informed guesses about what an encrypted letter's counterpart might be. If two of the same letter occur in a row, there are only a certain number of letters which could be the counterpart: <code>s</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>p</code>, and <code>n</code>. <code>U</code> is also a possibility, but only if the word is <i>vacuum</i>. It's also best to guess short words first, because of the low number of possiblities. <i>And</i>, <i>the</i>, <i>it / is</i> are all very common words which will almost always occur in the quote.</p> -->
      <!-- <h3>Credits</h3>
      <p>This version of this game is based heavily on the Android app of the same name. Quotes are from <a href="http://goodreads.com/quotes">Goodreads.com</a>. Otherwise created by Evan Derby.</p> -->
